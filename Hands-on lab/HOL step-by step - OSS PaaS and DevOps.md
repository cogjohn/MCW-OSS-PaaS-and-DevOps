# OSS PaaS and DevOps hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement a solution for integrating and deploying complex open-source software (OSS) workloads into Azure PaaS. You will migrate an existing MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application from a hosted environment into Azure Web App for Containers, migrate a MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB, enhance application functionality using serverless technologies, and fully embrace modern DevOps tools.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to migrate and deploy OSS applications into Azure PaaS using modern DevOps methodologies and Docker containers.

## Overview

Best For You Organics Company is one of the leading health food suppliers in North America, serving customers in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. They have a MERN stack web application which they host on-premises and are looking to migrate their OSS application into Azure. They will be creating a custom Docker image for their application and using a Jenkins continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to deploy the application into a Web App for Containers instance. In addition, they will be setting up Azure Cosmos DB, using the MongoDB APIs, so they do not have to make application code changes to leverage the power of Cosmos DB.

In this hands-on lab, you will assist with completing the OSS application and database migrations into Azure. You will create a custom Docker image, provision an Azure Container Registry, push the image to the registry, and configure the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application to a Web App for Containers instance. You will also help them implement functionality enhancements using serverless architecture services in Azure.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This diagram consists of icons that are connected by arrows. On the left, the Developer icon (VS Code) points in a linear fashion to the GitHub Repo and Jenkins icons. The previous two icons are enclosed in a box labeled CI/CD Pipeline. Jenkins points to Web App for Containers on the right. Various arrows point from Web App for Container to: Azure Container Registry (a double-sided arrow); Logic Apps (a linear arrow that also points from Logic Apps to Customers); Customers (a linear arrow); and Azure Cosmos DB (a double-sided arrow that also points from Azure Cosmos DB to Azure Functions with another double-sided arrow).](media/solution-architecture-diagram.png "Solution architecture diagram")

The solution begins with developers using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as their code editor, so they can leverage its rich integration with GitHub, Docker, and Azure. From a high level, developers will package the entire OSS application inside a custom Docker container using the Docker extension in VS Code. The image will be pushed to an Azure Container Registry as part of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub and Jenkins. This Docker image will then be deployed to a Web App for Containers instance, as part of their continuous delivery process using The Azure App Service Jenkins plugin.

The MongoDB database will be imported into Azure Cosmos DB, using mongoimport.exe, and access the database from the application will continue to use the MongoDB APIs. The database connection string in the application will be updated to point to the new Cosmos DB.

Serverless architecture will be applied to order processing and customer notifications. Azure Functions will be used to automate the processing of orders. Logic Apps will be applied to send SMS notifications, via a Twilio connector, to customers informing them that their order has been processed and shipped.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN
    - Trial subscriptions will *not* work.
2. Linux virtual machine configured with:
    - Visual Studio Code
    - Azure CLI

5. Select **Connect** on the Remote Desktop Connection dialog.

6. Select **Yes** to connect, if prompted that the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Remote Desktop Connection prompt about connecting to the remote despite the identity of the remote computer being unverified. Yes is selected.](media/image20.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog box")

7. Enter the following credentials (or the non-default credentials if you changed them):

    - **User name:** demouser
    - **Password:** Password.1!!

        ![The credentials above are entered in the Login to xrdp dialog box.](media/image21.png "Login to xrdp dialog box")

8. Select **OK** to log into the Lab VM.

### Task 2: Grant permissions to Docker

In this task, you will grant permissions to the demouser account to access the Unix socket needed to communicate with the Docker engine.

1. On your Lab VM, open a bash shell.

2. At the command prompt, enter the following command:

    ```sh
    sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
    ```

3. After running the command, you will need **completely log out of the Lab VM** and log back in (if in doubt, reboot).

4. After logging back in, run the following command to test that the demouser account has proper permissions:

    ```sh
    docker run hello-world
    ```

    ![Screenshot of the bash shell command sudo usermod -a pG docker \$USER output. Includes output from running the test command, docker run hello-world.](media/image22.png "Bash Shell")

### Task 3: Integrate GitHub into VS Code

In this task, you will install the GitHub extension in VS Code, and configure a service integration with your GitHub account. This integration will allow you to push your code changes to GitHub directly from VS Code.

1. On your Lab VM, open **VS Code**.

2. In VS Code, select the **Extensions** icon from the left-hand menu, enter "github" into the **Extensions** search box, and select the **GitHub** extension.

    ![Extensions is highlighted in the Visual Studio Code navigation pane, github is entered in the Extensions search box, and GitHub is highlighted below.](media/image23.png "Visual Studio Code navigation pane")

3. Select **Install** in the Extension: GitHub window.

    ![Install is highlighted in the Extension: GitHub window.](media/image24.png "Install the GitHub extension")

4. Close VS Code.

    >**Note**: VS Code must be restarted to enable the extension.

5. To connect VS Code with your GitHub account, you need to generate a Personal access token.

6. Open a browser window and navigate to your GitHub account (<https://github.com>).

7. Within your GitHub account, select **your user profile icon** in the top right, then select **Settings** from the menu.

    ![The user profile icon is highlighted at the top left of the GitHub account page, and Settings is highlighted in the submenu.](media/image25.png "Select your account settings")

8. On the Settings screen, select **Developer settings** at the bottom of the Personal settings menu on the left-hand side of the screen.

    ![Developer settings is highlighted at the bottom of the Personal settings menu on the Settings screen.](media/image26.png "Select Developer settings")

9. On the Developer settings page, select **Personal access tokens** from the left-hand menu.

    ![Personal access tokens is highlighted on the Developer settings page.](media/image27.png "Select Personal access tokens")

10. Select **Generate new token**.

    ![The Generate new token button is highlighted on the Personal access tokens page.](media/image28.png "Select Generate new token")

11. Enter a token description, such as "VS Code Integration", and then check the box next to **repo** under **Select scopes**, which will select all the boxes under it.

    ![On the New personal access token page, VS Code Integration is entered under Token description, and the check boxes next to and under repo are selected under Select scopes.](media/image29.png "Select the scopes")

12. Select **Generate token** near the bottom of the screen.

13. Select the **copy** button next to the token that is generated.

    ![The copy button that is next to the new personal access button is highlighted.](media/image31.png "Copy the new personal access button")

    >**Important**: Make sure you copy the new personal access token before you navigate away from the screen, or you will need to regenerate the token. Save the copied token by pasting it into a text editor for future reference. This will also be used as your password when pushing changes to GitHub.

14. Open **VS Code** on your Lab VM.

15. Select the **View** menu, then select **Command Palette** from the menu.

    ![View is highlighted in the menu, and Command Palette is highlighted below.](media/image32.png "Visual Studio Code window, View menu")

16. In the box that appears at the top center of the VS Code window, enter "Set Personal Access Token," then select **GitHub: Set Personal Access Token**, when it appears.

    ![GitHub: Set Personal Access Token is highlighted below Set Personal.](media/image33.png "Select GitHub: Set Personal Access Token")

17. Paste the Personal access token you copied from GitHub into the box, and press **Enter**.

    ![The Personal access token is pasted in the box.](media/image34.png "Paste the Personal access token")

18. VS Code is now connected to your GitHub account.

19. Close VS Code.

### Task 4: Clone the starter application

In this task, you will clone the starter application, creating a local copy on your Lab VM.

1. On your Lab VM, open a browser, and navigate to your GitHub account (<https://github.com>).

2. Within your GitHub account, navigate to the forked copy of the `mcw-oss-paas-devops` application page, select **Clone or download**, then select the **copy** link next to the web URL.

    ![The Clone or download button is selected on the forked copy of the mcw-oss-paas-devops application page, and the web URL is displayed below it.](media/image35.png "Select Clone or download")

3. Open a new bash shell, and enter the following command:

    ```sh
    cd ~
    ```

4. Next, enter the following command, replacing [EMAIL] with the email address you used when creating your GitHub account. This will associate your git email address with the commits made from the Lab VM.

    ```sh
    git config --global user.email "[EMAIL]"
    ```

    ![The above command to associate your git email address with the commits made from the Lab VM is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/image36.png "bash terminal window")

5. At the prompt, enter the following command, replacing [CLONE-URL] with URL you copied from GitHub in step 2 above:

    ```sh
    git clone [CLONE-URL]
    ```

    ![The git clone command is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/image37.png "bash terminal window")

6. Now, change the directory to the cloned project by entering the following at the prompt:

    ```sh
    cd mcw-oss-paas-devops
    ```

    ![The command to change the directory is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/image38.png "bash terminal window")

7. Finally, issue a command to open the starter project in VS Code by typing:

    ```sh
    code .
    ```

8. A new VS Code window will open, with the `mcw-oss-paas-devops` folder opened.

    ![The MCW-OSS-PAAS-DEVOPS folder is open in the Explorer pane in the Visual Studio Code window, and the Welcome pane is open on the right.](media/image39.png "Visual Studio Code window")

9. You are now ready to begin working with the project in VS Code.

### Task 5: Launch the starter application

In this task, you will seed the MongoDB with sample data, then run the application locally, connected to your MongoDB instance. This task is to verify the connection to MongoDB and that it contains the seeded plan data, before we migrate the application and data to Azure Cosmos DB.

1. Return to VS Code, select **View** from the menu, and select **Terminal**.

    ![Terminal is highlighted in the View (also highlighted) menu in Visual Studio Code.](media/visual-studio-code-view-terminal.png "Visual Studio Code View window")

2. This will open a new bash terminal window at the bottom of the VS Code dialog.

3. At the bash prompt, use the `npm install` command to ensure the required components are installed on your Lab VM.

    ```sh
    sudo npm install
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the terminal window at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code dialog box. The command above is entered at the command prompt, and the results of the command are displayed.](media/image41.png "Bash terminal window")

4. Next, enter the following to seed the local MongoDB database with plans, user accounts, and orders.

    ```sh
    node data/Seed.js
    ```

    ![The above command to seed the local MongoDB database is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/image42.png "Bash terminal window")

    >**Note**: If you receive an error that the service is not running, start the MongoDB service by executing the `sudo service mongod start` command at the shell prompt.

5. Next, build the application using the following:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

6. Finally, enter the following to start the web server for the application:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

7. Open a browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3000> to view the landing page of the starter application. You will see three plans listed on the application home page, which are pulled from the local MongoDB database.

    ![Two Person Plan, Four Person Plan, and High-Pro Plan boxes are visible in this screenshot of the application home page.](media/image43.png "View the three plans")

8. Return to the VS Code integrated terminal window, and press **CTRL+C** to stop the application.

## Exercise 2: Migrate the database to Cosmos DB

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will provision an Azure Cosmos DB account, and then update the starter application's database connection string to point to your new Azure Cosmos DB account. You will then, use `mongoimport.exe` to migrate the data in your MongoDB database into Cosmos DB collections, and verify with the application that you are connected to your Cosmos DB database.

### Task 1: Provision Cosmos DB using the MongoDB API

In this task, you will provision a new Azure Cosmos DB account using the MongoDB API.

1. In the Azure portal, select **+Create a resource**, **Databases**, the select **Azure Cosmos DB**.

    ![+ Create a resource is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, and Databases and Azure Cosmos DB are highlighted on the New blade.](media/image44.png "Azure Portal")

2. On the **Azure Cosmos** **DB** blade, enter the following:

    - **Account Name**: Enter "best-for-you-db-SUFFIX," where SUFFIX is your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure the name is unique (indicated by a green check mark).

    - **API:** Select **MongoDB**.

    - **Subscription:** Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

    - **Resource Group:** Select **Use existing** and choose the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group** you created previously.

    - **Location:** Select a location near you from the list (Note: not all locations are available for Cosmos DB).

    - **Enable geo-redundancy:** Unchecked

    - Select **Review + create** to move to the validation step.

    ![The information above is entered in the Azure Cosmos DB blade.](media/create-cosmos-db-settings.png "Azure Cosmos DB")

    - After the Validation has succeeded, Select **Create** to provision the new Azure Cosmos DB.
    
### Task 2: Update database connection string

In this task, you will retrieve the connection string for your Azure Cosmos DB database and update the starter application's database connection string.

1. When your Cosmos DB account is provisioned, navigate to it in the Azure portal.

2. On the **Azure Cosmos DB account** blade, select **Connection String** under **SETTINGS** in the left-hand menu, and copy the **PRIMARY connection string**.

    ![Connection String is selected under Settings on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade, and the Primary Connection String value is highlighted on the Read-write Keys tab on the right.](media/image46.png "Azure cosmos DB account blade")

3. Return to VS Code.

4. Open `app.js` from the root directory of the application and locate the line that starts with var **databaseUrl**.

    ![App.js is selected and highlighted in the Explorer pane in the Visual Studio Code window, and the line starting with var databaseUrl is highlighted on the right.](media/image47.png "Visual Studio Code window")

5. Replace the value of the **databaseUrl** variable with the Cosmos DB connection string you copied from the Azure portal.

    ![The value of the databaseUrl variable is displayed in the Visual Studio Code window.](media/image48.png "Visual Studio Code window")

6. Scroll to the end of the value you just pasted in and locate **10255/?ssl=** in the string.

    ![10255/?ssl= is highlighted in the string in the Visual Studio Code window.](media/image49.png "Visual Studio Code window")

7. Between the "/" and the "?" insert **best-for-you-organics** to specify the database name.

    ![best-for-you-organics is selected in the string in the Visual Studio Code window.](media/image50.png "Visual Studio Code window")

8. Save `app.js`.

9. In the VS Code integrated terminal, enter the following command to rebuild the application:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

10. When the build completes, start the application by typing the following:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

11. Return to your browser and refresh the application page. Note: You may need to press **CTRL+F5** in your browser window to clear the browser cache while refreshing the page.

    ![This is a screenshot of the refreshed application page.](media/image51.png "Refreshed application screenshot")

12. Notice the three plans that were displayed on the page previously are no longer there. This is because the application is now pointed to your Azure Cosmos DB, and there is no plan data in that database yet.

13. Let's move on to copying the data from the local MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB.

### Task 3: Pre-create and scale collections

In this task, you will create the collections needed for your database migration and increase each collection's throughput from the default 1,000 RUs to 2,500 RUs. This is done to avoid throttling during the migration, and reduce the time required to import data.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB account, select **Browse** from the left-hand menu, under **COLLECTIONS**, and select **+Add Collection**.

    ![Browse is selected and highlighted in the left-hand menu of your Azure Cosmos DB account, and + Add Collection is highlighted on the right.](media/image52.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

2. In the **Add Collection** dialog, enter the following:

    - **Database id:** Select **Create new**, and enter "best-for-you-organics".

    - **Collection Id:** Enter "orders".

    - **Storage capacity:** Select **Fixed (10 GB)**.

    - **Throughput:** Enter "2500".

    - Select **OK** to create the collection.

        ![The information above is entered in the Add Collection dialog box.](media/add-orders-collection.png "Add Collection dialog box")
        
3. If they do not already exist, use the best-for-you-organic database id to repeat steps 1 and 2 to create collections for:

    - users
    - plans

4. If the users and plans collections already exist from your application connecting, edit each collection to increase their throughput using the following steps:

    - Select **Scale** from the left-hand menu, under **COLLECTIONS**.

    - Expand the existing collection and select **Scale & Settings**.

    - Enter "2500" into the **Throughput** box and select **Save**.

    ![Scale is highlighted under Collections. The turned delta next to users is highlighted under Collections, Scale & Settings is selected and highlighted below it, and Save is highlighted on the Scale & Settings tab on the right. 2500 is entered in the Throughput box on the Scale & Settings tab.](media/db-collections-adjust-scale.png "Collections section")
    
### Task 4: Import data to the API for MongoDB using mongoimport

In this task, you will use `mongoimport.exe` to import data to your Cosmos DB account. There is a shell script located in the `mcw-oss-paas-devops` solution which handles exporting each collection to a JSON file.

1. Next, you will execute a script file, included in the project files you downloaded, to handle exporting the data out of your MongoDB into JSON files on the local file system. These files will be used for the import into Cosmos DB.

2. On your Lab VM, open a new integrated bash prompt in VS Code by selecting the **+** next to the shell dropdown in the integrated terminal pane.

    ![This is a screenshot of the terminal window at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code dialog box. The + button is highlighted.](media/image55.png "Bash terminal window")

3. At the prompt, enter the following command to grant execute permissions on the export script:

    ```sh
    chmod +x ~/mcw-oss-paas-devops/data/mongo-export.sh
    ```

4. Next, run the script by entering the following command:

    ```sh
    ~/mcw-oss-paas-devops/data/mongo-export.sh
    ```

    ![The above command to export data from the local MongoDB database is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/image56.png "Bash terminal window")

5. The script creates the folder ~/MongoExport, and exports each of the collections in your MongoDB to JSON files.

6. You are now ready to import the data into Azure Cosmos DB using `mongoimport.exe`.

7. Use the following command template for executing the data import:

    ```sh
    mongoimport --host <your_hostname>:10255 -u <your_username> -p <your_password> --db <your_database> --collection <your_collection> --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file ~/MongoExport/<your_collection>.json
    ```

8. To get the values needed for the template command above, return to the **Connection string** blade for your Azure Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal. Leave this window up, as will need the **HOST, USERNAME**, and **PRIMARY PASSWORD** values from this page to import data to your Cosmos DB account.

    ![Connection String is selected under Settings on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade. On the Read-write Keys tab on the right, the values under Host, Username, and Primary Password are highlighted.](media/image57.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

### Task 5: Install Docker on the Jenkins VM

In this task, you will install Docker CE on your Jenkins VM, so it can be used to build images from the build artifacts produced by your CI build.

1. The first step is to ensure no older versions of Docker are installed on your Jenkins VM. Using the SSH tunnel bash terminal you opened previously, navigate to the command prompt, and enter:

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
    ```

2. Next, you need to set up a Docker repository on the host machine. The begin, update the `apt` package index:

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

3. Install the necessary packages to allow `apt` to use a repository over HTTPS, entering `y` when prompted to continue.

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common
    ```

4. Add Docker's official GPG key.

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

5. Verify that you now have the key with fingerprint `9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88`, by searching for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint:

    ```sh
    sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
    ```

6. You should see output similar to:

    ```sh
    pub   4096R/0EBFCD88 2017-02-22
        Key fingerprint = 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88
    uid                  Docker Release (CE deb) <docker@docker.com>
    sub   4096R/F273FCD8 2017-02-22
    ```

7. Next, enter the following commands to set up the **stable** repository.

    ```sh
    sudo add-apt-repository \
    "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) \
    stable"
    ```

8. You are now ready to install Docker CE. Start by updating the `apt` package index.

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

9. Install the latest version of Docker CE, entering `y` when prompted to continue.

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce
    ```

10. Verify that Docker CE is installed correctly by running the `hello-world` image.

    ```sh
    sudo docker run hello-world
    ```

11. The final step is to add permission to the `jenkins` user to Docker.

    ```sh
    sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins
    sudo chmod 664 /run/docker.sock
    ```

12. Now, restart the Jenkins service, entering the jenkinsadmin password, Password.1!!, when prompted.

    ```sh
    service jenkins restart
    ```

### Task 8: Trigger CI-CD pipeline

In this task, you will commit changes to the `mcw-oss-paas-devops` starter application and trigger the full CI/CD pipeline through Jenkins, resulting in the updated application being added to a new Docker image, pushed to ACR, and deployed to Web App for Containers.

1. Return to VS Code on your Lab VM, open the `.dockerignore` file, and delete the line containing __DockerFile*__ from the file. This will allow Jenkins to use the file to build the container in the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

2. Next, open the `src/components/plan/Plans.js` file, and insert the following markup between `<div class="container">` and `<Grid>`:

    ```html
    <h3>Welcome to Best For You Organics Company</h3>
    ```

    ![The src/components/plan/Plans.js file is highlighted on the left side of Visual Studio Code, and the markup above is highlighted on the right.](media/image174.png "VS Code")

3. Save the updated files.

4. As you did in [Task 4](#task-4-trigger-ci-build), above, select the **Source Control icon** from the left-hand menu, enter a commit comment, select **+** to stage the change, and select the **checkmark** to commit the change, and push to GitHub. Enter your credentials if prompted. This will trigger the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

    ![The updated files are listed under Staged Changes in VS Code, and a commit comment is entered.](media/visual-studio-code-cd-file-updates-commit.png "Visual Studio Code")

5. Return to your Jenkins dashboard, and select the **best-for-you-build** project, and select the latest build number under Build History.

    ![The Jenkins build history is displayed, with a progress bar next to #2](media/jenkins-build-history.png "Jenkins build history")

6. On the Build page, select **Console Output** from the left-hand menu.

    ![Console Output is highlighted in the left-hand menu on the Jenkins project build page](media/jenkins-build-console-ouptput.png "Build console output")

7. On the Console Output page, you can monitor the build progress. When it completes after a few minutes, you will see a SUCCESS message similar to the following:

    ![A build and Docker deployment success message is displayed in the console output in Jenkins](media/jenkins-build-console-output-success.png "Build and Docker deployment success")

8. Once the deployment is complete, you can verify the changes deployed successfully by going to Azure and reloading the web page for your App Service in the browser. The deployment of the container can take several minutes to complete so refreshes may take a few minutes to show the new header.

    >**Tip**: It may help to open the app in an Incognito or InPrivate browser window, so you don't have the old page cached.

9. When the deployment is complete you should see the home page, with a new header above the three plans on the page.

    ![Welcome to Best for You Organics Company! is highlighted above the Two Person Plan, Four Person Plan, and High-Pro Plan boxes in this screenshot of the home page.](media/image179.png "Home page")
